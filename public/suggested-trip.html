    <h1>Suggested Trip</h1>
    <p> Mexico has so much to offer, so here’s a suggested trip that lets you experience a lot while keeping it manageable and enjoyable. The suggested route is approximately 2 weeks. Let us know if you would like more tips for an even longer trip.</p>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Stop 1 CDMX - Port of Entry - 1-4 Days</h3>
      <p>Mexico City is the most convenient airport to fly into, with the widest range of routes, and it’s also a wonderful destination in itself. We suggest spending a few days here, anywhere from 1 to 4 depending on how much you’d like to explore. With 1–2 days, you can cover the main highlights in the city center: Chapultepec Park, the central square, a few museums, and of course plenty of amazing food. If you have 3–4 days, you can add an excursion to the incredible pyramids just outside the city, perhaps even by hot air balloon or another unique tour. When Kay and I visit, we love strolling through the central neighborhoods like Roma, Condesa, and around Chapultepec, discovering great shops and some truly outstanding restaurants.</p>

      <h3>Stop 2 Monterrey — Wedding - 2-3 Days</h3>
      <p>Monterrey is a wonderful city to live in, though it’s not often at the top of travelers’ lists. Most visitors come for business at the factories or, as in your case, for a wedding. Still, the city has its charms—fantastic restaurants and striking mountain landscapes—and you can easily experience the best of it in just 1 to 3 days.</p>

      <h3>Stop 3 The Beach — 7 days+ </h3>
      <p>On the east coast you’ll find destinations like Cancún, Tulum, Mérida, Holbox, Bacalar, and Playa del Carmen. This side of Mexico is known for its comfort and accessibility: world-class resorts, easy connections, and plenty of guided tours. Cancún and Playa del Carmen are ideal if you want an all-inclusive experience and lively nightlife. Tulum has become famous for boutique hotels, beach clubs, and a bohemian vibe. Mérida offers a more cultural touch with colonial architecture and Yucatán cuisine, while Holbox and Bacalar are quieter escapes—Holbox for its car-free island charm, Bacalar for its stunning ‘Lagoon of Seven Colors.</p>
      <p>On the west coast, you’ll find places like Los Cabos, Sayulita, Puerto Escondido, and Puerto Vallarta. The west coast is perfect if you’re drawn to surfing, rugged landscapes, and smaller towns. Sayulita has a relaxed surf-town atmosphere with lots of cafés and boutique shops. Puerto Escondido is more adventurous, known for surfing, turtles, and bioluminescent lagoons. Los Cabos offers dramatic desert-meets-sea scenery with luxury resorts, while Puerto Vallarta combines beaches with a charming old town and vibrant food scene.</p>
      <p>After the wedding, Kay and I—together with several close family members—are heading to Puerto Escondido. It’s one of our favorite places in Mexico, and anyone who’d like to join us is more than welcome! We can’t promise to spend all of our time together, but since Puerto Escondido is mostly about relaxing on the beach and enjoying great food, there will be plenty of opportunities to hang out in bigger groups.</p>
