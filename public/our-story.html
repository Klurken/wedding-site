    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>We first met at a party in Santiago in 2018 — the same town where we’re getting married. Marcus was in Mexico on an exchange year, and thanks to mutual friends, we kept running into each other until friendship gradually turned into something more.</p>
    <p>The timing wasn’t exactly ideal. Marcus was only in Mexico for a year, and when he went back to Sweden, we were suddenly long-distance. Two months later, Kay made the trip to Sweden to visit, and during that visit Marcus made it official “the Mexican way” by asking her to be his girlfriend. Just a couple of months later, Marcus was back in Mexico for good.</p>
    <p>Six months after that, we set off for Asia. It was the beginning of 2020, which turned out to be perfect timing for border restrictions and Covid chaos. What was supposed to be a few months abroad ended up being almost a year — mostly in Thailand (nice), with a quick trip to Vietnam (not great) and last in Sweden (okay). It wasn’t always smooth: living in a place where we didn’t speak the language while the world was shutting down had its challenges. But those challenges pulled us closer and gave us a lot of memories we still laugh about now.</p>
    <p>Kay got two months of Swedish light and then four months of Swedish darkness After trying it, we decided Mexico was probably a better fit for us, so we moved back to Monterrey.</p>
    <p>After a “creative housing” year in 2020. We landed our first apartment together under our good friends Juan and Valery. At the end of 2021 we moved out, and at the start of 2022 we finally got a place to make our own: an empty apartment in San Jerónimo. At that point we’d scraped together a bed, a table with chairs (thank you Kay’s parents), and a fridge… and then Svenne showed up. What was supposed to be a quick puppy visit turned into a permanent family member.</p>
    <p>2022 became the “build a home” year. We had friends close by, Jocke (Marcus’s brother) visited in March to meet Svenne, we squeezed in a month in Thailand (sorry, Svenne), and in November Marcus’s whole family came to visit in Mexico.</p>
    <p>In 2023 we spent a long spring in Monterrey and then did a small summer Euro trip (again, sorry, Svenne). Kay was excited; Marcus was nervous. Marcus proposed — and Kay said yes.</p>
    <p>Back in Mexico, Kay opened her flower shop, Svea. Marcus tried a small vintage clothing shop with at the same time that didn’t stick, but we learned a lot. By the end of 2023 Marcus proposed again, this time in Monterrey with Kay’s parents’ blessing.</p>
    <p>In 2024 we moved the shop, put most of our time into the new space, and started planning the wedding. And now it’s 2025 — back in Santiago, where this all started — getting ready to celebrate with everyone who’s near and dear to us!</p>
