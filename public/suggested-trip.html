    <h1>Suggested Trip</h1>
    <p> Mexico has so much to offer, so here’s a suggested trip that lets you experience a lot while keeping it manageable and enjoyable.</p>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Stop 1 — CDMX</h3>
      <p>Mexico City is the most convenient airport to fly into, with the widest range of routes, and it’s also a wonderful destination in itself. We suggest spending a few days here—anywhere from 1 to 4 depending on how much you’d like to explore. With 1–2 days, you can cover the main highlights in the city center: Chapultepec Park, the central square, a few museums, and of course plenty of amazing food. If you have 3–4 days, you can add an excursion to the incredible pyramids just outside the city, perhaps even by hot air balloon or another unique tour. When Kay and I visit, we love strolling through the central neighborhoods like Roma, Condesa, and around Chapultepec, discovering great shops and some truly outstanding restaurants.</p>
